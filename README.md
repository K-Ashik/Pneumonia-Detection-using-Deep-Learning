# Pneumonia Detection using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project utilizes deep learning techniques, specifically the VGG16 convolutional neural network, to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of images labeled as either "normal" or "pneumonia".

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia]. It consists of two main classes:
- Normal: Chest X-ray images of patients without pneumonia.
- Pneumonia: Chest X-ray images of patients diagnosed with pneumonia.

The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with appropriate preprocessing applied using Keras' `ImageDataGenerator`.

## Model Architecture
The VGG16 model, pre-trained on ImageNet, is employed as the base model. The top layers of VGG16 are adapted to fit the binary classification task of pneumonia detection. The model is fine-tuned by freezing the convolutional base and training only the custom classifier layers.

## Training
The model is compiled with:
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Cross-Entropy, suitable for multi-class classification.
- **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer for efficient weight updates.
- **Metrics**: Accuracy metric to monitor model performance during training.

The training process involves iterating through batches of augmented images generated by `ImageDataGenerator`, optimizing the model parameters to minimize the loss function.

## Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated on a separate test set to assess its ability to generalize to unseen data. Evaluation metrics include accuracy and loss on both training and validation sets across epochs.

## Prediction
Once trained, the model can make predictions on new chest X-ray images to classify them as either normal or indicating pneumonia. The predictions are based on the highest probability output from the softmax layer of the model.
